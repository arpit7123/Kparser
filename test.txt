An object is thrown with a horizontal speed of 20 m/s from a cliff that is 125 m high.
The object falls for the height of the cliff.
If air resistance is negligible, how long does it take the object to fall to the ground?
What is the duration of the fall?

Cervical cancer is caused by a virus.
That has been known for some time and it has led to a vaccine that seems to prevent it.
Researchers have been looking for other cancers that may be caused by viruses.

There was a table in the corner.
The waiter took the order.
The atmosphere was warm and friendly.

The first school for the training of leader dogs in the country is going to be created in Mortagua and will train 22 leader dogs per year.
In Mortagua, Joao Pedro Fonseca and Marta Gomes coordinate the project that seven people develop in this school.
They visited several similar places in England and in France, and two future trainers are already doing internship in one of the French Schools.
The communitarian funding ensures the operation of the school until 1999.
We would like our school to work similarly to the French ones, which live from donations, from the merchandising and even from the raffles that children sell in school.

As the 3 guns of Turret 2 were being loaded, a crewman who was operating the center gun yelled into the phone, ``I have a problem here.
I am not ready yet.
Then the propellant exploded.
When the gun crew was killed they were crouching unnaturally, which suggested that they knew that an explosion would happen.
The propellant that was used was made from nitrocellulose chunks that were produced during World War II and were repackaged in 1987 in bags that were made in 1945. Initially it was suspected that this storage might have reduced the powder's stability.

Amid the tightly packed row houses of North Philadelphia, a pioneering urban farm is providing fresh local food for a community that often lacks it, and making money in the process.
Greensgrow, a one-acre plot of raised beds and greenhouses on the site of a former steel-galvanizing factory, is turning a profit by selling its own vegetables and herbs as well as a range of produce from local growers, and by running a nursery selling plants and seedlings.
The farm earned about $10,000 on revenue of $450,000 in 2007, and hopes to make a profit of 5 percent on $650,000 in revenue in this, its 10th year, so it can open another operation elsewhere in Philadelphia.

Modern development of wind-energy technology and applications was well underway by the 1930s, when an estimated 600,000 windmills supplied rural areas with electricity and water-pumping services.
Once broad-scale electricity distribution spread to farms and country towns, use of wind energy in the United States started to subside, but it picked up again after the U.S. oil shortage in the early 1970s.
Over the past 30 years, research and development has fluctuated with federal government interest and tax incentives.
In the mid-'80s, wind turbines had a typical maximum power rating of 150 kW.
In 2006, commercial, utility-scale turbines are commonly rated at over 1 MW and are available in up to 4 MW capacity.
